 * Game Start Controller: On Update
 *
 * Added to the game start object's Step event.
 *
 * When the window is moving the game will pause but delta_time will continue to count up.
 * So I've added a limit to how high my delta_time variable is allowed to get. TICK is used
 * with timers and with entity movement. So having TICK suddenly be in the hundreds
 * (when its usually around one) will caused everything to launch at lightning speeds and
 * cause the timers to abruptly end.
